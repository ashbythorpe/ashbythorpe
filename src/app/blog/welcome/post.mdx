# Welcome, and how to make a website

This blog is going to be a place where I can write about programming:
experiences I've had, things I've made, even the occasional how-to every now
and again.

In today's post, I want to discuss the website you are in right now! It's going
to be a fairly short one, and a fairly boring one: call it a test post. In
future posts, I'd like to talk more about programming patterns and conventions,
rather than the tools I've used.

## Prior experience

I was pretty new to full stack development before this project. However, I was
*very* experienced with [shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/), a full stack
development framework in R. To be honest, shiny is pretty much the furthest you
can get from traditional full stack tools: it is designed to be easy to use for
small, simple web apps that have no real need for styling or speed (although
this didn't stop me from producing
[an absolutely gargantuan project](https://github.com/ashbythorpe/financialDataAnalysis)
in the form of a shiny app).

However, while experience in shiny does not lend itself to certain parts of the
web developer's experience, it certainly helped in a few specific areas. For
one, shiny is particularly keen on reactive programming, and the mild usage of
reactive thinking in frameworks like React seemed almost trivial in comparison.
Similarly, a module in shiny seemed equivalent to a web component in any other
framework. More generally, I typically found the broader concepts of web
development pretty easy to grasp, and more often had trouble with specific
details or conventions of the framework at hand.

## Software

A personal site isn't that exciting of a project so rather than talking about
how I made the site, I'd like to focus more on the specific tools I used, and
the experience I had with
each one.

Notably, I won't mention TypeScript, not because it wasn't an amazing
improvement to the horrors of JavaScript, but because everyone else who has
ever used it will tell you the exact same thing.

### Next.js

The most obvious influence on  a person's experience when building a website is
the web framework they use, in my case [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I chose
it because it seemed popular, simple and used React.

To begin with, I was proved right: my website was set-up and deployed in an
amazingly short period of time. The first few pages of my website were very
simple, and as a result I found it very easy and quick to make, while still
resulting in a very performative website.

That all being said, I ran into a few issues once I started on the blog section,
which, with its comment section, was the most complex part of the website.

The first issue I ran into was a bit more of a niche one. All my blog posts are
written in Markdown and rendered using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). MDX is, for
the most part, a wonderful tool, essentially acting as a compiler for Markdown,
and even allowing the embedding of custom components in your files (allowing
for the [wonderful syntax highlighting](https://bright.codehike.org/) I use in
my posts).

However, I wanted a custom layout for each blog post, which would
add some styling and a comment section to it. Normally, a `layout.tsx`
file would allow me to share a layout between multiple pages. Unfortunately,
I needed the name of each post in order to fetch the corresponding comments,
and this information was not available inside a `layout.tsx` file. I didn't
want to have to include code for the layout in every single file, but the
alternative was barbaric: I would have to use a dynamic route segment, and
manually render the MDX file for each layout. In the end, a template file and
a simple shell script made breaking the rule of DRY much more palatable, and so
I managed to avoid too much added complexity. However, I still felt like I was
hacking around a problem that Next.js should have been able to solve on its own.

The second issue that I repeatedly encountered was the idea of client and server
components. I am quite sure that this is the most common issue developers face
when introduced to the Next.js framework. Before working on the blog section,
I had been able to dodge this issue by simply adding or removing a
`"use client"` in any file that caused an error. Of course, this did not work
in any situation that was even the slightest bit too complex, and I soon found
myself overwhelmed by errors that I did not quite understand.

Of course, I had a solid understanding of the client-server model in web
applications, it was just Next.js's specific representation of this problem
that baffled me. It took me a while to understand why the exact same code would
work in one file and not in another. In fact, I found it extremely useful to
unpack the ideas that Next.js provided and consider them in the context of the
client-server model I was familiar with. For example, it seems quite obvious
that to query a database on the client, you need to go through the server first
(to hide credentials), but in practice many of my server-side components
*could* query my database directly, making this two-stop route seem
counter-intuitive. This still frustrates me now, it seems to demonstrate that
the abstractions provided by Next.js are leaky and overbearing.

I would love to explore how other frameworks deal with this issue, and whether
they provide a more clear separation of the client and server.

### React

Working with Next.js meant, of course, working with
[React](https://reactjs.org/). This was by choice: as much as I was compelled
by newer tools like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and
[SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/), React's popularity made it a more
attractive choice for a first project.

Although I had plenty to say about Next.js, my experience with React, was, for
the most part, quite pleasant. I had a good grasp of the fundamentals of
reactivity, which made the concepts that React put forward easy to master.
Furthermore, it seemed to provide convenient solutions to many of the problems
that I encountered while developing the website, such as prop drilling and
optimistic state.

One of the tools I most enjoyed using was server actions, which allowed me to
skip over a lot of the pain involved with using forms. I think once of the
reasons my experience with React was so positive was that my website was not
complex enough to run into most of the foot-guns and pitfalls of React in
larger projects. For example, the server actions would not work in the context
of multi-part forms.

### Prisma

To interact with my database of users and comments, instead of opting for the
traditional SQL approach, I decided to use [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), a
database ORM that allowed me to query my data in a simpler, type-checking way.

My initial experience with Prisma was a little painful. While the code itself
was easy to understand, I had a little trouble using the tooling, especially
when trying to update the database. I found myself often having to reset all
my data to accommodate a small change in the structure of one of my tables.
And even when I managed to update the remote database  successfully, I found
that the generated types would be out-of-date, generating diagnostics in my
editor for perfectly valid queries.

However, once I had gotten over these initial hurdles, I found Prisma to be a
particularly powerful tool. It especially shined when I started to implement
a reply system for my comments, which required a two self-referential relations
that would be difficult to express using normal SQL, but were almost trivial
to add in my schema file.

```prisma
model Comment {
  id              Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  postId          Int
  createdAt       DateTime  @default(now())
  content         String
  userId          String
  replyId         Int?
  originalReplyId Int?
  blog            Blog      @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  user            User      @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  replyTo         Comment?  @relation("reply", fields: [replyId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  directReplies   Comment[] @relation("reply")
  originalReplyTo Comment?  @relation("originalReply", fields: [originalReplyId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  replies         Comment[] @relation("originalReply")
}
```

simple, the relations at the end would be much more difficult to represent
using SQL.

### Tailwind CSS

The final notable tool that I relied upon was
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I had heard a lot of good things about
Tailwind, and I was keen to try it out.

I was not disappointed. Tailwind made me realise just how much I hated writing
regular CSS. It was fast, very well-documented and fun to use, and for the first
time, I enjoyed customising my components at what felt like double the speed.
Above all, I enjoyed the *simplicity* of it; it removed a barrier of abstraction
that regular CSS ushers you behind, reducing the gap between the design in your
head and the code you create. Once you reject the re-usability that regular
CSS classes provide you with, you realise you didn't need it in the first place.
